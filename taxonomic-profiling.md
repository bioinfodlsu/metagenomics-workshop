# Taxonomic Profiling
One typical task is to figure out the taxonomic composition of the sampled microbial community, i.e. to find out what species are present and in what proportion. 

The basic idea is to assign each read (or read pair) to a sequence in a reference database

## Using comprehensive whole-genome databases



## Using only marker genes known for discriminatory power between species
