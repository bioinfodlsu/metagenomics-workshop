# Taxonomic Profiling
A typical task is to figure out the taxonomic composition of the sampled microbial community, i.e. to find out what species are present and in what proportion. 

There are many tools available for this task. The basic idea behind all of them to assign reads to  sequences in a reference database, and then count the number of reads to compute relative abundance. Broadly speaking, there are two choices for the reference database. 

## Using comprehensive whole-genome databases



## Using only marker genes known for discriminatory power between species
